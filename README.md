### Known issues

#### OSRS Font Scaling
The Old school RuneScape fonts are bitmap fonts. 
This means they do not scale well in size and have ugly edges and artifacts when using a font size that is not a multiple of 16.
It is recommended to specify a font in the settings when using such font size.

#### Predicted hits
Predicted hits will never be 100% accurate. Predicted hits are calculated from the hitpoints experience gained. 
The amount of hitpoints experience gained correlates with the amount of damage done however it is not exact.
Round of experience gained happens on the server before it is sent to the client. 
Furthermore, some monsters in OSRS give bonus experience in the form of a multiplier over the experience gained.
This plugin tries to use the same multipliers per monster but the list is incomplete leading to incorrect predicted hits.

#### XP drops are delayed
Try increasing the `Vertical XP drop speed` and/or lowering the `XP drop delay` settings. 
The plugin uses these settings to determine by how much consecutive XP drops should be delayed to prevent overlapping.
If these settings are configured in such way that xp drops do not clear the screen fast enough for new XP drops the queue of XP drops will keep backing up resulting in a delay.

### Installing custom fonts
When installing custom fonts on Windows make sure to use "Install for all users" otherwise the plugin might not be able to find the font.
Once installed, enter the name of the font under Font in the plugin settings. This field is case-insensitive.
Fonts that are shipped with Windows should not need to be installed.\
