### Known issues

#### OSRS Font Scaling
The Old school RuneScape fonts are bitmap fonts. 
This means they do not scale well in size and have ugly edges and artifacts when using a font size that is not a multiple of 16.
It is recommended to specify a font in the settings when using such font size.

#### Predicted hits
Predicted hits will never be 100% accurate. Predicted hits are calculated from the hitpoints experience gained. 
The amount of hitpoints experience gained correlates with the amount of damage done however it is not exact.
Round of experience gained happens on the server before it is sent to the client. 
Furthermore, some monsters in OSRS give bonus experience in the form of a multiplier over the experience gained.
This plugin tries to use the same multipliers per monster but the list is incomplete leading to incorrect predicted hits.

#### XP drops are delayed
Try increasing the `Vertical XP drop speed` and/or lowering the `XP drop delay` settings. 
The plugin uses these settings to determine by how much consecutive XP drops should be delayed to prevent overlapping.
If these settings are configured in such way that xp drops do not clear the screen fast enough for new XP drops the queue of XP drops will keep backing up resulting in a delay.

#### There is a gap between my overlays / XP drops overlay is sorted before x overlay (even when no xp drops are visible)
This has to do with the sorting of the overlays that are in the same overlay group.
Tune `Xp drop overlay priority` to a lower value until this is not a problem anymore OR do not snap the overlay to an overlay group (the boxes when you hold the alt key).

#### The XP drops are off center
When `Attach to player` and `Attach to target` are disabled you can enable `Force xp drops to be centered` under `Miscellaneous` and tune `Center xp drop on` to your liking.\
When `Attach to player` or `Attach to target` is enabled the xp drops are centered on the position of the player or target on your screen. 
You can use 'Center xp drop on', 'Attach to x offset' and 'Attach to y offset' to fine tune the position of the xp drop with relation to the player or target.

### Installing custom fonts
When installing custom fonts on Windows make sure to use "Install for all users" otherwise the plugin might not be able to find the font.
Once installed, enter the name of the font under Font in the plugin settings. This field is case-insensitive.
Fonts that are shipped with Windows should not need to be installed.\

### Vanilla XP drops
This plugin replaces vanilla XP drops however using (close to) the following settings they can easily be mimicked if you play on fixed client layout.
The vanilla xp drops speed depends on the size of the game canvas therefore the defaults given below only match vanilla behaviour on fixed layout client size.
Note that you can view both customizable xp drops and vanilla xp drops at the same time by setting `Hide vanilla xp drops: false` under the Miscellaneous tab in the plugin settings for easy comparing.
Note that when using ungrouped xp drops the `XP drop delay` setting is also important and depends on size and speed.\
Vanilla XP drop Size smallest:  `Font style: Default`, `Background: Shadow`, `Font size: 12`, `Icon size override: 0`.\
Vanilla XP drop Size medium:    `Font style: Default`, `Background: Shadow`, `Font size: 16`, `Icon size override: 25`.\
Vanilla XP drop Size largest:   `Font style: Bold`, `Background: Shadow`, `Font size: 16`, `Icon size override: 25`.\
Vanilla XP drop Speed slower:   `Vertical XP drop speed: 44`.\
Vanilla XP drop Speed default:  `Vertical XP drop speed: 60`.\
Vanilla XP drop Speed faster:   `Vertical XP drop speed: 90`.
